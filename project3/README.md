# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Imen Bakir


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. There are approximately 183412 rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater "San Francisco Bay" area.

## Summary of Findings

Most users were Male. This can be justified by the imbalanced number of female riders compared to male ones.

Most users were subscribers and not Customers.

The distribution of duration was a bit surprising as the minutes charts were 30 minutes or less for most users.

The female distribution depending on their Age are younger than male.

Male users tend to go on shorter bike rides compared to other and female riders.

The subscribers are slightly older than customers on average but take much shorter/quicker ride.

More customers than Subscribers tend to go on bike rides between hours of 8-9am and 5-6 pm.

More Subscribers take bike rides on the hours of 7:30-8am and 4-6pm.

Customers have a very low usage of the bike share system with a small increase on Thursdays.

Subscribers are the opposite. The rate of bike riders are very high especially on Thursdays but it drops significantly on Saturdays and Sundays.

## Key Insights for Presentation

The best part of renting a bike from the Ford GoBike System is that you do not have to worry about owning a bike. With rentals, you can easily access a bike for as long as you wish and have as much fun as you want. 

There are two types of clients using this system: Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers are primarily daily commuters, having short trips to and from their destination which can be estimated as work or school, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm.

Customers are usually occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends or certain days such as Thursdays to explore the Bay Area probably. Also, the subscribers are slightly older than customers on average but take much shorter/quicker ride.

These are the two key insights that I will be investigating in my presentation
